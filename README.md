## 📖 Our Story

When we embarked on the comprehensive **CampusX Data Science Master Program (DSMP) 2.0**, we quickly realized the sheer magnitude of the curriculum ahead of us. With **200+ sessions**, covering everything from Python fundamentals to advanced MLOps, spanning across **60+ weeks** of intensive learning, we found ourselves struggling with a common problem:

> *"How do we effectively track our progress through this massive learning journey?"*

We tried spreadsheets, notebooks, and various apps, but nothing quite captured the essence of our learning journey. We needed something that could:
- ✅ Handle the complete DSMP 2.0 curriculum structure
- ✅ Provide visual feedback on our progress
- ✅ Remember our achievements between study sessions
- ✅ Work seamlessly across all our devices
- ✅ Give us that satisfying feeling of checking off completed sessions

That's when we decided to build our own solution! 🚀
